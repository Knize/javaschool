            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Hyperloop is a tradename and a registered trademark of the
                Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) for the high speed transportation of passengers and
                goods in tubes[1][2] in which capsules are propelled by linear induction motors and air compressors.[3]

                Recently there has been a resurgence in interest in pneumatic tube transportation systems since being
                reintroduced, using updated technologies, by Elon Musk,[4][5] incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in
                which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air
                compressors.[3]

                The outline of the original Hyperloop concept was made public by the release of a preliminary design
                document in August 2013, which included a notional route running from the Los Angeles region to the San
                Francisco Bay Area, paralleling the Interstate 5 corridor for most of its length. Preliminary analysis
                indicated that such a route might obtain an expected journey time of 35 minutes, meaning that passengers
                would traverse the 350-mile (560 km) route at an average speed of around 600 mph (970 km/h), with a top
                speed of 760 mph (1,200 km/h). Preliminary cost estimates for the LA–SF notional route were included in
                the white paper—US$6 billion for a passenger-only version, and US$7.5 billion for a somewhat
                larger-diameter version transporting passengers and vehicles[5] —although transportation analysts
                doubted that the system could be constructed on that budget.[6][7][8]

                Hyperloop technology has been explicitly open-sourced by Musk and SpaceX, and others have been
                encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them. To that end, several companies have been formed,
                and dozens of interdisciplinary student-led teams are working to advance the technology.[citation
                needed]

                Designs for test tracks and capsules are currently being developed, with construction of a full-scale
                prototype 5-mile (8 km) track scheduled to start in 2016.[9] In addition, a subscale pod design
                competition on a very short, 1 mile (1.6 km), test track was built in Nevada – the first tests of the
                scale model occurred in May 2016.[10]</p>
